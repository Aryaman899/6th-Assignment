ðŸ“š How It Works

The Entry widget is used as a display screen for input and results.

Button widgets represent digits and operators.

Each button triggers a function:

click(num) â†’ Appends numbers to the input field.

add(), sub(), mul(), div() â†’ Stores the first number and the chosen operation.

equal() â†’ Performs the stored operation with the second number.

clear() â†’ Clears the input field.
